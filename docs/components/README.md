Per-component documentation has been consolidated into the repository `README.md` as the canonical, reviewer-focused reference.

If you need to add longer examples or detailed notes, prefer adding them to `examples/components/` and mention them in `README.md`. Small per-component stubs remain for historical reference but the README is the single source of truth for quick review.
